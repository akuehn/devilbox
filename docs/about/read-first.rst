   1. This one indicates that the command should be executed on your host operating system. (When copying commands, do not copy the ``host>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

       host> command

   2. This one indicates that the command should be executed inside the currently selected PHP container.  (When copying commands, do not copy the ``php>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash
