Shell commands:
---------------

.. important::

   All shell commands in this documentation use two different formats:

   1. This one indicates that the command should be executed on your host operating system. (When copying commands, do not copy the ``host>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

       host> command

   2. This one indicates that the command should be executed inside the currently selected PHP container.  (When copying commands, do not copy the ``php>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

       php> command


Checklists
----------

.. note::
   Most guids and tutorials provide a **Checklist** at the very bottom.
   You can as well jump to it and quickly see if you have done everything already.
