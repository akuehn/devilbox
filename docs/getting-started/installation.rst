Install Requirements
====================

Both ``Docker`` and ``Docker Compose`` are required for the devilbox to run. They are
available for Linux, Windows and MacOS. Below are their minimum required versions:

* ``Docker``: 1.12.0+
* ``Docker Compose``: 1.9.0+


Additionally you will require ``git`` in order to clone the devilbox project.

.. warning::
   :ref:`docker_toolbox`
      Use **native Docker** and do not use the **Docker Toolbox**. If you still have to use the
      Docker Toolbox (e.g. for Windows 7) read up on this section.


Download the devilbox
=====================

The devilbox does not need to be installed. The only thing that is required is its git directory.
To download that, open a terminal and copy/paste the following command.

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox

That's it, you have finished the first section.
